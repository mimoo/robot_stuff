The idea is to play with your friends, and with a timer.

1. Set the timer to X minutes
2. If someone finds a solution, they must yell the number of moves
3. Reset the timer
4. Now the person that finds the solution with the less move wins (if nobody finds a better solution, the original solution wins)
